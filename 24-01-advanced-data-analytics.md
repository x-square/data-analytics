Data analytics has a lot to offer a nonprofit organization. Gaining deeper insight into the organization's efforts can help them to operate in a more effective and efficient way. Analyzing data can improve various nonprofit functions, such as allocation of resources, recruiting and retaining supporters, fundraising, and conducting research. Data analysis also can help reveal patterns and power dynamics that can be used to inform decision-making. In addition to identifying individuals and communities in need of assistance, predictive modeling can also be used to identify potential recipients of a nonprofit's services.

Data analytics professionals can help nonprofit organizations in a variety of ways:

- Fundraising
    - Using data analytics, you can predict with high accuracy which prospects are most likely to donate. In order to maximize return on marketing and outreach expenses, nonprofit organizations can use data analysis to prioritize outreach and reduce overall marketing expenditures.
- Marketing
    - There is valuable information in a nonprofit's data that can benefit marketing efforts. Data analysis can help determine a nonprofit's target audience and gather insights such as donation methods, contribution history, and other demographics. As a result, the nonprofit can help guide communication with potential donors and determine the effectiveness of campaigns.
- Monitoring activities
    - Data analysis can help nonprofits monitor resources, expenses, and daily operational needs. A nonprofit will often need assistance in keeping track of donated materials. For example, a database of donations to a food bank could help the organization determine specific food items being collected and inventory the expiration dates of food items for shelving, cycling, and distribution. Using a system of real-time inventory in conjunction with predictive data analytics could anticipate shortages and identify those donors who have helped provide these items in the past.
    - Using data analysis, this organization guides restorative efforts in underserved communities. DataKind brings together volunteer experts from academia and industry to design innovative solutions to tough social challenges. They help social organizations apply their data to predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and AI in a way that both increases impact and is sensitive to ethical considerations.
- Hackathons
    - A hackathon is an event where programmers and other data professionals come together and collaborate on a particular project. The goal is to create a solution to an existing problem.
    - Hackathon events are commonly built around a central theme or question, such as tracking industrial emissions, promoting healthy food options, or how we can improve mental health for cancer patients.

## Critical data security and privacy principles

As a data analytics professional, you have a responsibility to handle data ethically. Data ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used. Throughout your career you will work with a lot of data. This sometimes includes PII, or personally identifiable information, which can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity. One element of treating data ethically is ensuring that the privacy and security of that data is maintained throughout its lifetime.

### Privacy matters

Data privacy means preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. This is also called information privacy or data protection. Data privacy is concerned with the access, use, and collection of personal data. For the people whose data is being collected, this means they have the right to:

- Protection from unauthorized access to their private data
- Freedom from inappropriate use of their data
- The right to inspect, update, or correct their data
- Ability to give consent to data collection
- Legal right to access the data

In order to maintain these rights, businesses and organizations have to put privacy measures in place to protect individuals' data. This is also a matter of trust. The public's ability to trust companies with personal data is important. It's what makes people want to use a company's product, share their information, and more. 

### Protecting privacy with data anonymization

Organizations use a lot of different measures to protect the privacy of their data subjects, like incorporating access permissions to ensure that only the people who are supposed to access that information can do so. Another key strategy to maintaining privacy is data anonymization. 

Data anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.

Data anonymization is used in just about every industry. As a data analytics professional, you probably won't personally be performing anonymization, but it's useful to understand what kinds of data are often anonymized before you start working with it. This data might include:

- Telephone numbers
- Names
- License plates and license numbers
- Social security numbers
- IP addresses
- Medical records
- Email addresses
- Photographs
- Account numbers

Imagine a world where we all had access to each other's addresses, account numbers, and other identifiable information. That would invade a lot of people's privacy and make the world less safe. Data anonymization is one of the ways we can help keep data private and secure!

### The practices and principles of good data stewardship

As you have been learning, all data professionals are responsible for ensuring the quality, integrity, accessibility, and security of data. Data stewardship is the practice of ensuring that data is accessible, usable, and safe. Making data stewardship a normal part of your work habits will benefit everyone who relies on your analysis, both inside and outside of your organization. In the following, you will learn some tips about data stewardship and receive some best practices that can assist in guiding your career in data analytics.

- Respect privacy
- Be cautious of unintentional harm
- Avoid creating or reinforcing bias
- Consider inclusivity
- Uphold high standards of scientific excellence

## Build the perfect data team

### Data professional profiles within large organizations

- Data Scientist
- Data Analyst
- Data Engineer
- Analytic Team Manager
- Business Intelligence Engineer

### Five principles for data team building

1. Adaptability
   - Data platforms, networks and storage options need to allow flexibility. Each data professional will have their preferences as to the tools and their approaches to analysis. Remote and on-site employees need to have access and the ability to work with all data and use the tools of communication they feel are the most productive.
   - Keep your desire for learning. Expand your knowledge through online data science communities and educational opportunities.
2. Activation
   - Access to data analysis results require someone with the background and experience of a data analyst. Even small-scale data operations require skills that go beyond the scope of other professionals within an organization.
   - Maintain positive professional relationships through effective communication. Your ability to share insights is just as important to an organization as your analyzing skills.
3. Standardization
   - An organization needs to set criteria for the standardization of data practices and procedures. Standardization helps to promote best practices, and communication and transferability of information between teams. When users can share optimized code and other assets it saves development time and streamlines projects. An organization that builds a culture of collaboration embeds best practices into work behaviors.
   - Become a problem solver. Obstacles within a project can turn into opportunities for innovation, which can transform an organization.
4. Accountability
   - Data analysis is a complex and dynamic process that requires a high level of accountability. To promote responsibility, organizations need a ‘paper trail' that allows examination of their entire process.
   - Data analytics professionals are more than repositories of information. It benefits everyone involved in a project if you are able to communicate your knowledge and observations. Identify what would be most valuable to others and provide the information.
5. Business impact
   - Often, the inability to estimate the impact on the business can block data analysis projects. Organizations are not considering all available data analytical solutions during the planning stage.
   - Focus on communicating clearly with stakeholders. Maintain a commitment to consistency between what you have promised and what you will deliver.

As you consider the skills you are developing now, it can be useful to consider all the ways you might also use them in the future. 

#### Artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence, or AI, refers to computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. One of the great benefits of using AI for data science is that it can help provide real-time insights to stakeholders. For example, a business with an e-commerce website might use AI to monitor and deliver insights about how customers use their website in real-time, allowing the team to make quick improvements. 

#### Machine learning

Machine learning is the use and development of algorithms and statistical models to teach computer systems to analyze and discover patterns in data. Data analysts can train algorithms to analyze large amounts of data that would otherwise take a long time to process. For example, a financial analyst might use machine learning to find patterns in the data that help identify fraud. 

One of the most exciting developments in these future technologies is the way they can be used together to automate tasks and provide insights faster than ever.

## How data professionals use AI

### The uses of AI for data work

Data professionals can use AI to improve their data analysis, perform essential tasks, and streamline their workflow. For example, data professionals can use AI to:

- Create predictive models to help accurately forecast future events or outcomes. 
- Automate time-consuming tasks such as data cleaning, coding, and report writing. 
- Analyze extremely large datasets. 
- Improve the quality of data by identifying and correcting errors. 
- Generate insights from data that would not be obvious to humans. 
- Provide guidance on tasks such as choosing the right algorithms and interpreting results. 
- Facilitate collaboration among team members. 

Data professionals can leverage AI to enhance the quality and efficiency of their data projects, generate valuable insights, and help stakeholders make better business decisions. 

### Conversational AI tools: Bard and ChatGPT

Many data professionals now use conversational AI tools to help them analyze their data and boost their productivity. Two of the most frequently used tools are Bard and ChatGPT.  Bard was created by Google AI. ChatGPT, also known as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, was developed by OpenAI. 

Bard and ChatGPT are both large language models (LLMs) that are trained on massive datasets of text and code. An LLM is a type of AI algorithm that uses deep learning techniques to identify patterns in text and map how different words and phrases relate to each other. This allows LLMs to predict what word should come next. LLMs can generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. 

Tools like Bard and ChatGPT can help data professionals in a variety of ways. A data professional might ask Bard or ChatGPT to: 

- Clean a dataset by removing missing values, outliers, and duplicate data.
- Create interactive data visualizations such as dashboards and heatmaps. 
- Recommend a specific algorithm for a particular task based on the data professional's input.
- Create a shared document to facilitate a brainstorming session among a team of data professionals.

### Use cases for AI

Data professionals can use AI to help automate tasks, make predictions, generate insights, and communicate findings. They can leverage AI to be more productive in their work and more impactful in their organizations. Overall, AI is a powerful tool for data professionals but it is not without limitations. For this reason, human oversight and intervention is critical when working with AI and related tools.

#### Finance

- Analyze financial transactions to help prevent fraud and protect customers' money.
- Analyze large datasets of financial data to help identify potential risks and make more informed decisions about investments.
- Analyze historical market data and current market conditions to help generate sound investment recommendations. 

#### Retail

- Recommend products to customers based on their past purchase history and browsing behavior. 
- Track customers' interactions with the retail website to help personalize the shopping experience. 
- Analyze sales data and forecast future demand to help optimize the amount of product inventory and reduce costs. 

#### Manufacturing  

- Automate tasks such as welding, painting, and assembly to help improve efficiency.
- Analyze data from sensors and cameras to help identify defects in products before they are shipped to customers. 
- Analyze data from production lines to help identify ways to produce more products at a lower cost.

#### AI and human data professionals

Data professionals use AI as a tool to help them understand data, make better decisions, and improve efficiency. Like all tools, AI has limitations. Human data professionals possess skills, abilities, and qualities that AI currently lacks.

- **Intuition**
    - AI models are trained on data, and they can only make decisions based on the patterns they observe in the data. Humans can use their intuition and personal experience to make decisions that are not explicitly programmed into the AI model.
- **Deal with ambiguity**
    - AI models are good at solving problems that are well-defined and have clear parameters. However, humans can identify and understand complex problems that are not well-defined and have ambiguous parameters by considering key details offered in the context of the project.
- **Interpersonal communication**
    - AI models can generate reports and presentations, but they cannot communicate with stakeholders in the nuanced way that humans can. Humans can explain the results of their analysis to fit the needs of specific stakeholders, and use their emotional intelligence to address concerns.
- **Creativity**
    - AI models are good at following instructions, but they are not imaginative like humans. Humans can be creative in their approach to data analysis, and imagine new and innovative solutions to complex problems.
- **Critical thinking**
    - Humans can think critically about their data and identify potential biases and ethical issues. AI models are usually trained on real-world data that contains biases and are therefore likely to reflect those biases in model outputs.
- **Leadership**
    - Humans can be leaders, and they can motivate and inspire others. AI may have difficulty understanding the nuances of human emotion, motivation, and communication. This limits AI's ability to effectively run an organization.
- **Factuality**
    - Generative AI models are trained to output text based on patterns in language. Sometimes the model output may be very well-composed and as a result, seem reliable, but may not be factual. As noted above, it's important to always verify model output.

## Make the most out of mentorships

Mentors are professionals who share knowledge, skills, and experiences to help you grow and develop. They can offer guidance at different points in your career.

![PACE model](https://github.com/x-square/visual-resources/blob/main/pace-model.png?raw=true "PACE model")

Let's take a closer look at each stage of the PACE model.

### Plan

At the beginning of a project, it is important to establish a solid foundation for success. Here you will define the scope of your project. This is when you will begin by identifying the informational needs of the organization. During the planning stage, you will have the widest viewpoint of a project. By assessing all of the factors and processes involved, you are mapping a path to completion, using your creativity to conceptualize a course of action. Here you will also take special note of tasks that may require an innovative approach within your workflow.

The planning stage is where you conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project. Here are a few examples of the types of planning stage tasks:

- Research business data
- Define the project scope
- Develop a workflow
- Assess project and or stakeholder needs

### Analyze

In the analyzing stage, you will interact with the data for the first time. Here you will acquire all of the data you will need for the project. Some datasets could come from primary sources within your organization. Others may need to be collected from secondary sources outside your company. You may even find that you need governmental or open source data. The analyzing stage is also where you will engage in exploratory data analysis or EDA. This involves cleaning, reorganizing and analyzing all of the necessary data for the project.

The analyzing stage is where you will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project. Here are a few examples of the types of analyzing stage tasks:

- Format database
- Scrub data
- Convert data into usable formats

### Construct

Just as the name suggests, the construction stage is all about building. In this stage of PACE, you will be building, interpreting, and revising models. Some projects will require machine learning algorithms to uncover correlations within your data. You will use these correlations to uncover information from the data that would otherwise go unused. These relationships can help your organization make informed decisions about the future.

In the construction stage, you will build models that will allow you access to hidden relationships locked within data. Here are a few examples of the types of construction stage tasks:

- Select modeling approach
- Build models
- Build machine learning algorithms

### Execute

In the execution stage, you will put your analysis and construction into action. Here you will deliver your findings to the internal (inside of your organization) and external (outside of your organization) stakeholders. Quite often, this will involve stakeholders from the business-side of the companies you are working with. Presenting your findings is only a part of the execution stage. Stakeholders will provide feedback, ask questions, and make recommendations that you will collect and incorporate.

In the execution stage you will present the finding of your analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary. Here are a few examples of the types of execution stage tasks:

- Share results
- Present findings to other stakeholders
- Address feedback

## Best communication practices for data professionals

Effective communication is important for data professionals. Regardless of where you are in the framework of a project, communication can inform and empower your stakeholders. Identify the needs of your audience and invite feedback. Remember that your role is to connect the data, technology, and the stakeholders. When sharing the results of your data analysis, make your presentations clear, focused, accessible, and take into account any assumptions or limitations presented by the data. Demonstrate your value by being available and ready to share insights in a simple way that promotes general understanding.

### Seven tips for effective communication

1. Speak the language of your audience
   - Identify the needs of your audience. It's important to know the objectives of the person you are communicating with. Focusing on their needs allows you to gain insight and assess how technical the conversation should be.
       - Why has this person contacted you?
       - What does your stakeholder want from this interaction?
       - What's important to them, their team, or their organization?
   - Determine what they know, what they need to know, and what might go beyond their level of involvement in a project.
       - Break down technical concepts into simpler terms. 
       - Use shorter sentences so main ideas are easier to understand and remember.
       - Use direct language and minimize embellishments or unnecessary detail.
       - Pay attention to diverse backgrounds and respect the lived experiences of others.
   - Avoid jargon, acronyms, and technical **buzzwords** that could lead to confusion.
2. Invite questions and welcome feedback
   - Everyone can use feedback, whether it is positive reinforcement or areas for improvement. When you are focused on the details of a task, it's possible to overlook something. Another person's feedback offers you a great way to gather insights for your personal growth and professional excellence. By accepting the challenge that feedback and questions present, you will strengthen your own skills and help the overall project.
       - Merge your passion for finding solutions with the goals of the project.
       - Continue to strive for greater understanding of the results.
       - Elicit feedback and questions to improve communication about your projects.
       - Consider opportunities to reflect on your communication skills.
   - Analyze feedback. Is it valid? Does the person have a complete understanding of the goals of the project or data analytical process? If not, set up an additional meeting to help clarify.
3. Be the connection to the data
   - You are your team's direct connection to the insights your data offers. Your goal is to help other stakeholders understand the process and how it addresses their needs. When everyone understands the process, communication can be highly effective.
       - Focus on the objectives to help others better understand your data process.
       - Tell the story of the data with a compelling and cohesive narrative.
       - Respond to questions in a timely manner.
       - Demonstrate your value to the team. 
       - Find opportunities to address stakeholder questions.
   - Continue to proactively identify ways the data and tools you have access to can address the objectives of your team and drive new insights. 
4. Let your visualizations help tell the story
   - Visualizations are one of the best ways to communicate ideas, especially when dealing with big data. Visual references help bring to life the details inside your data. Graphs, charts, and infographics can promote general understanding. Later you will explore Tableau, a visualization tool that you can use to create compelling visuals from data.
       - Be sure that your visuals tell the story within the data.
       - Design visualizations for inclusivity.
       - Use labels and text to clarify, not clutter.
       - Use fonts that are easy to read.
       - Use high contrast, shading, and other customizations to communicate your messages clearly.
       - Offer handouts, slides, and other material in accessible formats.
    - Keep visualizations simple. When deciding what to include in a presentation, less is more.
5. Build positive professional relationships
   -  When you consider the responsibilities and objectives of others, your communication will reflect that consideration. This builds credibility and influence in your workplace and allows you to continue growing throughout your career. 
       - Focus on what matters to your audience.
       - Invite feedback and discussion.
       - Be a trusted subject matter expert who communicates clearly and inclusively.
       - Cultivate positive interactions to strengthen working relationships and improve morale.
   - When a stakeholder contacts you, be accessible and engaged in your communication.
6. Identify assumptions about the data
   - The backgrounds, experiences, beliefs, and worldviews of people can influence the information contained within data. In your role as a data analytics professional, you will want to consider ways that these various factors can introduce bias.
   - If they are not recognized, assumptions can have a powerful effect on outcomes. Without information, there is often a tendency to fill in the gaps in understanding with assumptions. The most effective methods to reduce the impact of assumptions are practicing active listening and effectively asking questions.
       - Is there something I am taking for granted?
       - Am I assuming something here that I shouldn't?
       - Can I determine if the assumption is correct?
   - Data professionals need to identify their own assumptions as well as any assumptions their audience might have. Make sure you consider any bias you might have, too!
7. Identify limitations in the data 
   - As a data professional, you will also encounter limitations within data that can impede your analysis. These limitations will need to be addressed before you can proceed.
       - Is the data complete? Are there missing values or sections?
       - Are the datasets formatted correctly?
       - Is this a sufficient sample size to conduct analysis of an entire population or group?
       - What are the biases present in the data set?
       - Does this data contain personally identifiable information? What steps will I take to protect this information?
   - In addition to identifying and communicating about data limitations before analysis, you will also need to     

### Share Findings

One of the most important communications you will have with stakeholders will be sharing your findings, often through presentations. This will mean translating the results, concepts, and terms of your analysis for wider audiences. When sharing the results of your analysis with stakeholders, there are some best practices that you should apply:

- Craft results to the needs of your stakeholders. Communicate why this data will help them achieve their goals.
- Determine the visualizations and or dashboards that are the most effective. What data will you need to show and how do you want stakeholders to interact with it?
- Think about the design carefully. A simple yet visually appealing approach to visualizations is always the best.
- Use a hierarchy of data in your visualizations or dashboards. Information that is most important should be easily accessible, but you should provide a path for more details.
- What should I keep in mind when I share results?
    - What information is the most important to my audience?
    - What is the most efficient way to share with the tools available and the time I'm allotted?
    - What can I do to make the key points effectively?

### Presentations

Presenting information clearly and effectively is key to a data scientist's workflow. Communication skills that pertain to presentations include but are not limited to: the structure of your presentation, slide design, the tone of your voice and the body language you convey, and more. It's also important to consider accessibility as you are creating any assets. Check with your organization about accessibility guidelines.

- Structure your presentation. Be sure there is a logical structure: a beginning, middle, and end.
- Presentation slides are not scripts. Don't read or put complete paragraphs on presentation slides.
- Make sure your data can be understood visually and consider potential accessibility challenges for your audience.
- Focus most on the points your data illustrates.
- Share one—and only one—major point from each chart.
- Label chart components clearly.
- Visually highlight **Aha!** zones.
- Write a slide title that reinforces the data's point.

## Communicate with stakeholders in different roles

### Exemplar email #1 to the new data professional

- An overview of the data team's workflow. This information gives the new data professional insight into how the data team shares their results and invites feedback from internal stakeholders.
- The accuracy goal for the visitation prediction model. Knowing the project objective is important for a data professional working to develop an effective ML model.
- Invite the recipient to ask follow-up questions. Questions are an opportunity to improve communication and learn more about the project.

Dear Akbar,

My name is Cynthia, one of the data professionals with the National Park Service and a
member of the data team responsible for the visitation prediction project.

Welcome to the team! I look forward to working with you. As a data professional, you will need
to know about the data team's workflow.

At the start of a new project, the entire team contributes to a strategy document that includes
the project's scope and objective, data sources, and key milestones. Next, the team cleans,
organizes, and explores the data. Then, we build and test machine learning models. Finally,
we share the results with stakeholders and receive feedback. The accuracy goal for the
visitation prediction model is 90%.

If you have further questions about the project, please feel free to reach out anytime.

Cynthia Delgado\
Data Scientist\

### Exemplar email #2 to the new public relations writer

- Relevant information for creating non-technical articles that promote the NPS' mission and work. This information includes the purpose and benefits of the visitation prediction project, and the problem the project is addressing. 
- Direct, non-technical language that does not include unnecessary detail.
- Invite the recipient to ask follow-up questions. Questions are an opportunity to improve communication and learn more about the project.

Dear Victoria,

My name is Cynthia, one of the data professionals with the National Park Service and a
member of the data team responsible for the visitation prediction project.

Welcome to the team! I look forward to working with you. I've been asked to provide you with
an overview of the visitation prediction project.

The recent increase in visitation is a major concern for the NPS. In 2022, the NPS received
about 312 million recreation visits, an increase of 15 million visits from 2021. 26 percent of
total visits occurred in the top 8 most visited parks. Unexpected increases in visitation can
stress the natural environments and wildlife within the parks, and reduce the overall quality of
visitor experience.

NPS leadership has asked the data team to build a model that will accurately predict future
visitation at the most visited parks. A powerful model can help park managers better
understand trends in future visitation, take proactive measures to protect the parks' natural
and cultural resources, and improve visitor experience.

If you have further questions about the project, please feel free to reach out anytime.

## Elements of successful communication

As you have been learning, communication is the driving force behind PACE because data professionals need to be able to communicate effectively with stakeholders while working through different stages of a project. You have already learned some important tips for effective communication. But, there are a few more elements for successful communication you should consider.

### Understanding why

Having a clear vision of why you are communicating is the first thing you need to consider. Your **why** depends on the context set by the business or organization you work for as well as the goals orienting the project. When crafting any form of communication, use your why to guide main ideas so that your audience can identify how to act or respond with purpose.

- Goals of the project you are communicating about
- What you hope to gain from this communication
- What you're asking your audience to do
- What you need your audience to understand

Understanding the why behind your communication will help you organize your thoughts and develop clearer, more direct communication. 

### Set the stage

When you are developing effective communication, you have to consider more than just the why. You also need to think about where the communication is taking place. Setting will have a direct impact on how your message is delivered and how you shape it. As you prepare to communicate, consider the most appropriate way to communicate for the setting you plan to be in.

- Ask a coworker for advice about a recent obstacle over lunch
- Send an email updating all the stakeholders about an important project
- Share progress with your team in a weekly meeting
- Present the results of your analysis to a boardroom of executives

Each of these settings will require you to consider how you're communicating, what each of those audiences need, and what you need from them in return. As you develop your communication skills, don't forget that the setting can be just as important as the actual communication.  

### All about time

Time is a currency in the professional world. It's very important to be efficient. This includes making sure your communication is understandable so that stakeholders can quickly comprehend your message. To ensure your message is clear and concise, remember to always:

- Use direct language 
- Minimize wordiness
- Avoid unnecessary details
- Always strive for clarity  
- Use proper grammar and punctuation
- Keep vocabulary simple and avoid technical language
- Break complex ideas into shorter sentences to make concepts easier to understand and remember

Not only will these suggestions help make your communication efficient and easier to understand, they will also save you time having to re-explain important concepts. And more than that, your colleagues will be grateful that you respected their time. 

### Active Listening

As you begin your career as a data professional, you will spend a lot of time in meetings and in conversation. Many stakeholders are from different departments both inside and outside of your organization. The information shared during these interactions is valuable. Often, it's where you gather insight into how the business operates, its goals, key milestones, and parameters within projects. 

- Invite understanding of others
- Develop empathy for others and their responsibilities 
- Build a connection with colleagues
- Promote trust

When you are practicing active listening, you make the effort to understand the speaker's point of view. This helps you understand what other people are trying to communicate and sets you up to ask better, more insightful questions.

### Asking Questions

Data professionals aren't automatically developing solutions. For data analysis to be effective, data professionals need to ask the right questions. In fact, the entire data analytical process depends on it. 

Asking questions is a powerful communication tool. Asking the right questions can lead to institutional learning and a fruitful exchange of ideas. Many times, questions invite innovation and initiate efforts that can help improve projects and overall workflow.

- Ask questions that haven't been answered already
- Ask questions that reveal the bigger picture
- Ask questions that gather information or further the knowledge of the team
- Ask questions that can help clarify misunderstandings

Effective questions are more likely to get you the answers you need to do your best work– which is good for the whole team.

## Communicate objectives with a project proposal

A project proposal can provide the structure and communication needed for tracking tasks. In addition, project proposals are beneficial for teams when facing challenges that require a high degree of flexibility. As projects progress, the expectations, resources, or even team members can change. This will require adjustments within a project that can impact the overall workflow and delivery date.

Each project proposal contains important information that a team will need to consider before work begins. Below is a brief explanation of some common sections you will find in project proposals. Note that the format of project proposals will vary, so not every section described here will be included in every project proposal.

- **Project title** is usually placed near the top of a document. Effective titles are brief and purposeful. Depending on the context and circumstances surrounding a project, the title can change over time.
- **Project objective** is a one to three sentence explanation of what the project is trying to achieve.
- **Milestones** are groupings of tasks within a project, breaking the work needed into smaller, manageable goals. Milestones assist in the delegation and scheduling of work that needs to be completed within projects. The milestones in the provided example are representative of future end-of-course projects.
- **Tasks** detail the work that needs to be completed within a milestone. The tasks in the provided example parallel some of the work you will complete in upcoming end-of-course projects.
- **Outcomes** are the completed actions or results that allow a project to continue.
- **Deliverables** are items that can be shared amongst team members or with stakeholders. These are the end products of work undertaken for a project.
- **Stakeholders** either individuals or groups are directly involved and have a vested interest in the success of a project. Input from stakeholders can serve as a basis for making decisions throughout a project.
- **Estimated time** is provided at the beginning of a project to indicate the time needed to complete milestones. As a project develops, these estimates will often need to be updated to account for adjustments to timelines or changes in team members.

### Sample project proposal

The sample project proposal, linked below, deals with a fictional visitation prediction project undertaken by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). Use this document as a reference as you review each of the following sections.

This project proposal's audience is the NPS data team. The purpose is to gather a comprehensive list of project tasks and divide them into smaller actionable groupings or milestones. Project proposals assist project managers in setting up task tracking, scheduling, and allocating resources. Furthermore, they serve as a reference for the team and as a valuable tool when new members are added to the project.

## Connect PACE with executive summaries

Executive summaries are documents that summarize the most important points about a project, giving decision makers a brief overview of the most relevant information. They can also be used to help new team members quickly become acquainted with a project. The format is designed to respect the responsibilities of decision makers and or executives who may not have time to read and understand an entire report.

Executive summaries are used across numerous industries and organizations. There are many ways to present information within an executive summary, including software options built specifically for that purpose. In this program, you will primarily consider a one-page format within a presentation slide. Although the design and layout of executive summaries can vary, there are key elements that are common among them.

Executive summaries are used across a wide variety of businesses and typically include the following elements:

- **Project theme** is incorporated into the executive summary title to create an immediate connection with the target audience.
- **Problem statement** focuses on the need or concern being targeted or addressed by the project. Note that the problem can also be referred to as the hypothesis that you're trying to prove through data analysis.
- **Solution statement** summarizes a project's main goal. In this section, actions are described that address the concerns outlined in the problem statement.
- **Details or key insights** are to provide any additional background information that may assist the target audience in understanding the project's objectives. Determining what details to include depends on the intended audience.
- **Next steps or recommendations** are information that supports the actions the team plans to take. This can also include recommendations for decision makers based on the insights gained over the course of the project. In this section, a data professional may also include general project reflections. When you are adding to this section, include at least one point for recommendations and one for the suggested next steps.

### Sample executive summary

The following linked sample executive summary deals with a fictional visitation prediction project undertaken by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The intended audience of this summary is a group of decision makers from NPS leadership. The purpose of this summary is to share the insights gained through data analysis of recreational park visits. Each section delivers a short statement without embellishment. This allows decision makers to quickly grasp the most relevant points about a project. Reference this document as you review each of the following sections.

### Meeting notes

Now that you are working as Automatidata’s latest data analytics professional, you are given access to the company network and set up with a company email account (your first initial and last name, followed by @automatidata.org).

Opening your inbox, you notice an email from your supervisor, Deshawn.

**From**: Deshawn Washington\
**Subject**: Review meeting notes

If you are able to read this, then your company accounts have been created! Now is the perfect time to get started. Last week, I attended an internal meeting with our leadership team about a new project we are about to begin. You’ll receive more information in the next few days, but I would like you to be aware of some needs that were identified by our leadership team. Here is an excerpt from the notes I took during the Automatidata leadership team meeting. I’ve organized the points by the person who made them.

Uli King  (Senior Project Manager)

- The data team will need a global-level project document to outline the goals and milestones.
- I am working closely with Titus Nelson over at the New York City Taxi and Limo Commission. He has requested some visuals to share with TLC’s executives.

Luana Rodriquez (Senior Data Analyst)

- The dataset from TLC has to be inspected before any analysis can begin. 
- Our team needs to determine what information the TLC data provides through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Eventually, our team will need to test to find if the model is delivering consistent results.

Udo Bankole (Director of Data Analysis)

- Before we present any insights to TLC, we'll need to determine whether or not the model we produce meets the project requirements.
- Once we have a final model, I'll need to know the main talking points going into our presentation with TLC.

My thoughts and concerns

- I think it's best to use Python for the TLC project. I'll have someone on my team set that up as soon as we have the plan in place.
- It will be important to establish the relationship between any variables within the TLC data. I'd suggest the data team consider A/B testing, since that will analyze the relationship between the two most useful variables and subsequently provide data-driven support for future business decisions.

Review the meeting notes above to become familiar with the project’s context. I’ll ask you to identify project tasks and come up with a structure to guide the data team through this project. After our discussion about your experience in the certificate program offered by Google, I know that your efficient communication style and problem-solving will enhance the abilities of the data team. 

There will be more details sent to you very soon.

Welcome to the team,

Deshawn Washington\
Data Analysis Manager\
Automatidata

(P.S. There will be muffins in the break room every Tuesday morning. Be early…unless you like bran muffins. LOL)

### Specific project deliverables
With this end-of-course project, you will gain valuable practice and apply your new skills as you complete the following:

- Course 1 PACE Strategy Document to plan your project while considering your audience members, teammates, key milestones, and overall project goal.
- Create a project proposal for the data team.

## TikTok scenario

Welcome to your new role at TikTok! We’re thrilled to have you on the data team! 

At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

### Project background

TikTok’s data team is in the earliest stages of the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

- Organize project tasks into milestones
- Classify tasks using the PACE workflow
- Identify relevant stakeholders

### Your assignment

For your first assignment, TikTok is asking for a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within the comment classification project. Remember to take into account your audience, team, project goal, and PACE stages of each task in planning your project deliverable.

### Team members at TikTok

As a new data analyst, you’ll work closely with a talented team of experienced data professionals. You’ll also collaborate with TikTok co-workers outside the data team as your project requires. 

#### Data team roles

- Willow Jaffey - Data Science Lead
- Rosie Mae Bradshaw - Data Science Manager
- Orion Rainier - Data Scientist

#### Cross-functional team members

- Mary Joanna Rodgers- Project Management Officer
- Margery Adebowale- Finance Lead, Americas
- Maika Abadi- Operations Lead

Note that the story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. The data shared in this project has been altered for pedagogical purposes.

Your TikTok team includes several managers overseeing operations. It is important to adapt your communication to their roles since their responsibilities are less technical. The members of the data team at TikTok are well versed in data analysis and data science. Messages to these more technical co-workers should be concise and specific.

### Meeting notes

Now that you are onboard, you have access to the company network and are set up with a company email account.

You notice an email from your supervisor at the top of your inbox.

**Subject**: Your first task: Review meeting notes

If you are able to read this, then your company accounts have been created! It’s the perfect time to get started with your first task. Last week, I attended an internal meeting with our leadership team about a new project we are about to begin. You’ll receive more information in the next few days, but I would like you to be aware of some needs that were identified by our leadership. Here is an excerpt from the notes I took during the leadership team meeting. I’ve organized the points by the individual who made the comment:

Mary Joanna Rodgers- Project Management Officer

- The project will need a global document identifying deliverables & milestones.
- We will need to generate some visuals to share with TikTok executives.

Orion Rainier-Data Scientist

- We will need to have an understanding of the data we will be working with on this project. 
- It will require someone on the team to inspect the dataset for missing data.
- The data team needs to determine what information will be the most useful in TikTok’s data through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Eventually, our team will need to run some method of statistical testing.

Willow Jaffey- Data Science Lead

- The goal of the claim classification project is to build and deliver a reliable machine learning model.
- The team will need to determine the type of regression model for this project.
- Once we have a final model, I'll need to know the main talking points going into our presentation to the leadership team.
- The team will need to determine the best method of hypothesis testing for this dataset.

My thoughts and concerns

- I think it's best to use Python for this project. I'll have someone on my team set that up as soon as we have the project proposal in place.
- I'd suggest the data team will need to check the assumptions made by any regression modeling developed for this project.
- The data team will identify and set up the project’s workflow.

There will be more details sent to you very soon.

Welcome to the team,

Rosie Mae Bradshaw\
Data Science Manager\
TikTok

(P.S. Don’t forget about the company-sponsored lunch on Friday. The food is always fantastic. It’s a great opportunity to meet more of our wonderful co-workers. Our team meets in the lobby around noon. Please join us!)

### Specific project deliverables

With this end-of-course project, you will gain valuable practice and apply your new skills as you complete the following deliverables:

- Course 1 PACE Strategy Document to plan your project while considering your audience members, teammates, key milestones, and overall project goal.
- Create a project proposal for the data team.

## Waze scenario

Welcome to your new role at Waze! We’re thrilled to have you on the data team! 

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

You’ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. In your role, you will analyze user data and develop a machine learning model that predicts user churn. 

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

- Who are the users most likely to churn?
- Why do users churn? 
- When do users churn? 

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may simply lose these users without knowing why. 

Your insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.  

### Project background
Waze’s data team is in the earliest stages of the churn project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

- Organize project tasks into milestones
- Classify tasks using the PACE workflow
- Identify relevant stakeholders

### Your assignment

For your first assignment, Waze is asking for a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within this project. Remember to take into account your audience, team, project goal, and PACE stages of each task in planning your project deliverable.

Note that this project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and does not represent Waze’s actual data.

### Team members at Waze

**From**:  May Santner, `may@waze.com`\
**Subject**: Your first task: Review meeting notes

If you are reading this message, then your company accounts have been created! Now is the perfect time to get started. Last week, I attended an internal meeting with our leadership team about a new project. You’ll receive more information in the next few days, but I’d like you to be aware of some key points made by leadership. Here is an excerpt from my meeting notes. I’ve organized the points by the person who made them.

Sylvester Esperanza, Senior Project Manager

- The data team will need a global-level project document to outline project goals and milestones.
- We will need to generate some visuals to share with the Waze executives.

Chidi Ga, Senior Data Analyst

- The dataset has to be inspected before any analysis can begin. 
- The data team needs to learn more about the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Eventually, our team will need to test the model to find out if it's delivering consistent results.

Harriet Hadzic, Director of Data Analysis

- Before we share any insights, we'll need to determine whether or not our model meets the project requirements.
- Once we finalize the model, I'll need to know the main talking points for our presentation to the leadership team.

My thoughts and concerns

- I think it's best to use Python for this project. I'll have someone on my team set that up as soon as we have the project proposal in place.
- It will be important to establish the relationship between key variables in the dataset. I'd suggest the data team consider hypothesis testing.

Review the meeting notes and proposed tasks from each team member to become familiar with the project’s context. I’ll ask you to identify project tasks and come up with a structure to guide the data team through this project. After our discussion about your experience in the Google certificate program, I know that your efficient communication style and strong problem-solving skills will help the data team achieve its goals. 

There will be more details sent to you soon.

: Programming language comparisons

## More about object-oriented programming

Previously, we identified object-oriented programming as a programming paradigm that is based around objects, which can contain both data and code that manipulates that data. You may recall that a class is an object’s data type that bundles data and functionality together, and you’ve encountered some examples of this class-specific functionality in the form of methods and attributes.

Classes comprise the core objects of Python, which is why Python is known as an object-oriented language. Class objects are powerful because they contain unique tools designed specifically for that class packaged within them. Methods are functions that belong to a class; they perform actions or operations, and they use parentheses. Attributes are values or characteristics associated with a class or class instance; they do not use parentheses. And, while there are many classes, attributes, and methods pre-built into Python, there is a high level of customization offered in the object-oriented programming paradigm.

### Attributes and methods

Python classes are powerful and convenient because they come with built-in features that simplify common data analysis tasks. These features are known as attributes and methods:

- **Attribute**: A value associated with an object or class which is referenced by name using dot notation.
- **Method**: A function that belongs to a class and typically performs an action or operation. 

A simpler way of thinking about the distinction between attributes and methods is to remember that attributes are **characteristics** of the object, while methods are **actions** or **operations**.

### If the class were Spaceship

Then attributes might be:

`name`, `kind`, `speed`, `tractor_beam`

These attributes could be accessed by typing:

`Spaceship.name`, `Spaceship.kind`, `Spaceship.speed`, `Spaceship.tractor_beam`

Notice that these characteristics are accessed using only a dot. 

Methods of the Spaceship class might be:

`warp()`, `tractor()` 

These methods could be used by typing:

`Spaceship.warp()`, `Spaceship.tractor()`

Notice that methods are followed by parentheses, and it’s possible for them to take arguments. For example, `Spaceship.warp(7)` could change the speed of the ship to warp seven.

### Defining classes with unique attributes and methods

Python lets you define your own classes, each with their own special attributes and methods. This helps all different kinds of programmers to build reusable code that makes their work more efficient. You can even build the Spaceship class mentioned previously. The example, here, demonstrates how to do this.

```python
class Spaceship:
   # Class attribute
   tractor_beam = 'off'

   # Instance attributes
   def __init__(self, name, kind):
       self.name = name
       self.kind = kind
       self.speed = None

  # Instance methods
   def warp(self, warp):
       self.speed = warp
       print(f'Warp {warp}, engage!')

   def tractor(self):
       if self.tractor_beam == 'off':
           self.tractor_beam = 'on'
           print('Tractor beam on.')
       else:
           self.tractor_beam = 'off'
           print('Tractor beam off')
```

A class is like a blueprint for all things that share characteristics and behaviors. In this case, the class is Spaceship. There can be all different kinds of spaceships. They can have different names and different purposes. Whenever you create an object of a given class, you’re creating an instance of that class. This is also known as instantiating the class. In the code above, every time you instantiate an object of the Spaceship class it will start with its tractor beam set to off. The tractor beam is a class attribute. All instances of the Spaceship class have one. There are also instance attributes. These are attributes that you can assign when you instantiate the object. 

```python
# Create an instance of the Spaceship class (i.e. "instantiate")
ship = Spaceship('Mockingbird','rescue frigate')

# Check ship's name
print(ship.name)

# Check what kind of ship it is
print(ship.kind)

# Check tractor beam status
print(ship.tractor_beam)

# Output
Mockingbird
rescue frigate
off
```

The next block of code uses the warp() method to set the warp speed to seven. Then it checks the current speed of the ship using the speed attribute.

```python
# Set warp speed
ship.warp(7)

# Check speed
ship.speed

# Output
Warp 7, engage!
7
```

This final block of code uses the tractor() method to toggle the tractor beam. Then it checks the current status of the tractor beam using the tractor_beam attribute.

```python
# Toggle tractor beam
ship.tractor()

# Check tractor beam status
print(ship.tractor_beam)

# Output
Tractor beam on.
on
```
